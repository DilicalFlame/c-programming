# Fundamental Data Types in C

| Data Type       | Keyword Used  |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Character       | `char`        |
| Integer         | `int`         |
| Floating Point  | `float`       |
| Double          | `double`      |
| Valueless       | `void`        |

These data types can vary in their:

1. Notation (signed and unsigned notation)
2. Size (short, long and long long sizes)

> Note:
>
> - Sizes are only defined on `int` and `long double` is also defined in c-program.
> - Notations are only defined on `char` and `int` families.
